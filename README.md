# SALES-DASHBOARD-EXCEL
As part of a dynamic project, I designed an advanced Excel dashboard tailored for a prominent food e-commerce company's analytics team. The primary objective was to empower business stakeholders with data-driven insights, enabling them to make informed decisions and drive performance improvements.

Here are the key highlights of the project:

1. **Data Aggregation and Transformation**:
 - I meticulously collected and organized data at the granular order_id level.
 - Calculated essential business metrics, including Average Order Value (AOV), Discount Percentage, Average Rating, and Average Delivery Time.

2. **Dashboard Structure**:
 - The Excel workbook consists of four interconnected sheets, enhancing user experience through slicers for city and restaurant selection.
 - Let's explore each sheet:

 - **Overall Numbers**:
 - Provides a high-level overview of company performance.
 - Includes month-wise revenue and order tables.
 - Visual representations showcase city and restaurant-wise orders.

 - **City-wise Dashboard**:
 - Focuses on city-specific insights.
 - Displays revenue and order trends, average delivery times, discount percentages, and restaurant ratings for each city.

 - **Restaurant-wise Dashboard**:
 - Dives into restaurant-specific performance.
 - Highlights revenue and order trends, average delivery times, discount percentages, and restaurant ratings for individual restaurants.

 - **Report to Manager**:
 - Summarizes key findings and insights derived from the graphs.
 - Provides a concise narrative for management decision-making.

3. **Impact and Empowerment**:
 - By creating this sophisticated dashboard, I've equipped business stakeholders with a powerful tool.
 - They can now understand the company's performance at a glance and confidently make data-driven decisions.
